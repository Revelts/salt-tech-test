The different within 'git rebase' and 'git merge' is 
- Git Rebase -> Git rebase actually reapplies our commits on top of another base branch, it doesnt merge histories commits etc.
- Git Merge -> Git merge actually joins two or more current development commits OR histories commits on the branch together into one.

Example Merge & Rebase: 
>Niki completed her feature/voicecall
>Jack completed his feature/videocall
>There would be a master branch.

[MERGE]
1. Niki merge his branch into master
2. Jack want to keep all history on master branches.
3. Jack use merge method by doing recursive strategy.
3. Jack making sure his local and remote master branches are in sync
4. Jack 'git checkout master' Then 'git pull' Master branch.
5. Jack 'git checkout feature/videocall' branch then Merge into master keeping all commits history.

[REBASE]
1. Niki merge his branch into master
2. Jack want to re-write history on master branches
3. Jack making sure his local and remote master branches are in sync
4. Jack 'git checkout master' Then 'git pull' Master branch.
5. Jack 'git rebase master feature/videocall' branch then Git will rewind and reapply the commits
